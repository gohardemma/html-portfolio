<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hi,i'm Emmanuel! I'm a web developer with in-depth experience in UI/UX design.
  In a nutshell, I create websites that help organizations address business challenges and meet their needs.
  I manage everything from website navigation and layout to a company's web hosting and security architecture.
  My expertise lies within front-end, and the main languages in my tech stack are JavaScript, React, and of course HTML/CSS.
  I'm a lifelong learner (currently taking a course on Udemy!) and love to read, run, and loves every little thing about Arsenal Football Club.

<p> I have been working as a web developer for quite some time now.
    I believe I am a very ambitious person who loves to work on making the website work well.
    Working on the web is my passion as I love to work on exciting projects.</p>

<p> I am a web developer who loves to create and beautify websites. 
    I love making new websites which are easy to use and can be accessed by anyone.
    I love to have my clients happy with the site's performance, which they are able to see on their personal devices.
    Apart from this, I have also worked in several renowned companies from around the world. 
    I hope I get the opportunity to work in your esteemed organization. That's all from my side. </p>
